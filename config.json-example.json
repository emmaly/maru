She works as a nurse at the Pelican Town clinic, making her one of Harvey's few close friends. She's the daughter of Robin and Demetrius and, while Sebastian is her half-brother, the two don't usually get along. Maru developed a passion for creating gadgets at a young age, encouraged by her carpenter mother and scientist father. She's in her mid 20s, is 5ft 4in tall, has reddish-brown shoulder length hair, red-framed glasses, her birthday is in the middle of summer, and she is currently single."
